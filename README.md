This SQL file creates a comprehensive Clinic Booking System database with tables for patients, doctors, appointments, medical records, billing, and staff. It enforces data integrity through primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK). The design includes 1-to-1, 1-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to model real-world clinic operations. Features include appointment scheduling, doctor specialties, room management, billing/payments, and patient records. Indexes optimize query performance, ensuring efficient data retrieval for a seamless healthcare management system

To run this project, execute the SQL script in a MySQL. Create the database, then run each table creation query sequentially to set up the Clinic Booking System.
